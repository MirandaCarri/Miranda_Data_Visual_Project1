In this visualization it shows the U.S. citizens Deaths in foreign countries. The dataset has about 13,000 data entries in it and is from the Travel.State.Gov website. At first appearance, you are defaulted to the all the foreign countries data put togther with a pie chart and a table chart. The pie will have 8 different slices that are color coded to a table chart of cause of death. The data scales each slice of pie depending on the number of deaths in a category that year. The table chart will display the exact numbers of each slice of the pie for my precision of data.
